# Qt6-Only Migration Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Summary

HyperRecall has been successfully migrated to **Qt6-only**. The Raylib backend has been completely removed to simplify the codebase and reduce maintenance burden.

## What Changed

### Removed Components
- ‚ùå **Raylib backend** - All C-based raylib UI code removed
- ‚ùå **src/main.c** - Raylib entry point
- ‚ùå **src/platform.c** - Raylib platform layer
- ‚ùå **src/ui.c** - Raylib UI implementation (~8000+ lines)
- ‚ùå **external/raygui/** - raygui header library
- ‚ùå Build options: `HYPERRECALL_UI_BACKEND`, `HYPERRECALL_USE_SYSTEM_RAYGUI`

### Current Architecture
- ‚úÖ **Qt6 C++ GUI** - Native desktop widgets (Widgets, Gui, Core modules)
- ‚úÖ **C17 Core** - Database, SRS algorithm, sessions, analytics
- ‚úÖ **Stub Functions** - render.c and media.c provide stub implementations for Qt6 builds
- ‚úÖ **Single Build Path** - No conditional compilation for backends

## Technical Changes

### Build System (CMakeLists.txt)
- Removed all raylib dependency detection
- Removed backend selection option
- Qt6 is now always required
- `CMAKE_AUTOMOC` always enabled
- Simplified to single build configuration

### Core Files
**src/types.h**
- Removed conditional `#ifndef HYPERRECALL_UI_QT6`
- Type definitions (Color, Vector2, Font, etc.) are now always available
- No longer includes `<raylib.h>`

**src/app.c, src/media.c, src/render.c**
- Removed `#ifndef HYPERRECALL_UI_QT6` guards
- Removed `<raylib.h>` includes
- Stub functions are now unconditional

**src/media.h**
- Removed conditional raylib include
- Clean interface independent of rendering backend

### Documentation Updates
**README.md**
- Updated description to mention Qt6 only
- Removed raylib installation instructions
- Simplified dependency list to Qt6 + SQLite3
- Updated project structure to show Qt6-only layout
- Removed build options for backend selection

**Makefile**
- Updated `install-deps` to install `qt6-base-dev` instead of `libraylib-dev`
- Simplified dependency installation across distros

## Migration Benefits

### Before (Dual Backend)
- üî¥ Complex conditional compilation (`#ifndef HYPERRECALL_UI_QT6` everywhere)
- üî¥ Two separate UI implementations to maintain
- üî¥ 8000+ lines of custom raylib UI code
- üî¥ raygui dependency management
- üî¥ Backend selection confusion for users

### After (Qt6 Only)
- ‚úÖ Single, clean codebase
- ‚úÖ Professional native desktop UI
- ‚úÖ No conditional compilation clutter
- ‚úÖ Reduced maintenance burden
- ‚úÖ Better desktop integration
- ‚úÖ Simplified build process

## What Still Works

### All Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Study sessions (Mastery, Cram modes)
- ‚úÖ SRS scheduling algorithm
- ‚úÖ Card management (17 card types)
- ‚úÖ Topic organization
- ‚úÖ Analytics and progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Import/Export (JSON, CSV)
- ‚úÖ Configuration management
- ‚úÖ Database operations

### Qt6 GUI Features ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Study screen with session management
- ‚úÖ Library screen with topic tree and card table
- ‚úÖ Analytics screen with statistics
- ‚úÖ Native menu bar and status bar
- ‚úÖ Native Qt widgets and dialogs
- ‚úÖ Professional desktop appearance

## Building HyperRecall

### Quick Start
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake ninja-build qt6-base-dev libsqlite3-dev
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/bin/hyperrecall

# Or use shortcuts
./run.sh
make run
```

### Windows
```powershell
# Install dependencies with vcpkg
vcpkg install qt6 sqlite3 --triplet x64-windows

# Build
.\run.ps1
```

## Developer Impact

### What Developers Need to Know
1. **No Backend Selection** - Qt6 is the only option now
2. **Simplified Includes** - No more `#ifndef HYPERRECALL_UI_QT6` guards needed
3. **Stub Functions** - render.c and media.c provide no-op implementations
4. **Qt C++ Required** - All GUI code is C++17 with Qt6
5. **C Core Unchanged** - Database, SRS, sessions remain pure C17

### Code Conventions
- **C Core** - All business logic remains in C17
- **C++ GUI** - All Qt6 UI code uses C++17
- **Extern "C"** - C/C++ boundary properly defined
- **No raylib** - Never include `<raylib.h>` or reference raylib functions

## Historical Context

HyperRecall originally supported two UI backends:
1. **Raylib** - Custom immediate-mode UI with manual widget implementation
2. **Qt6** - Native desktop widgets (added later for better UX)

The dual-backend system worked but created maintenance overhead:
- Conditional compilation throughout the codebase
- Two separate UI implementations to keep in sync
- Build complexity with backend selection
- User confusion about which backend to use

After implementing Qt6, it became clear that Qt6 provided a superior experience with professional widgets, better desktop integration, and lower maintenance burden. The decision was made to remove Raylib entirely.

## Future Development

All new features will use Qt6 exclusively:
- CRUD dialogs for topics and cards
- Advanced search and filtering UI
- Settings dialog
- Chart visualizations (using Qt Charts)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Any new UI components

## Migration Notes

**For Existing Users:**
- If you were using the Raylib backend, you'll need Qt6 installed
- All functionality remains the same, just with a native Qt interface
- Your database and configuration are compatible

**For Developers:**
- Remove any `#ifndef HYPERRECALL_UI_QT6` guards in new code
- Use Qt6 widgets for all UI work
- Keep business logic in C core
- Test with Qt6 only (no need to test multiple backends)

## Conclusion

The migration to Qt6-only simplifies HyperRecall's architecture while providing a superior user experience. The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and offers professional desktop integration that would be difficult to achieve with a custom UI toolkit.

**The application is fully functional and ready for use with Qt6!** üöÄ
