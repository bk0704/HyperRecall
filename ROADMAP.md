## Priority Next Steps

### High Priority (Critical for MVP)

1. **Runtime Verification** (1 day)
   - Test on Linux with X11
   - **Verification Checklist**:
     - [ ] Application launches without crashes
     - [ ] Theme loads correctly (Neon Dark default)
     - [ ] Card list displays and scrolls smoothly
     - [ ] Create new card (ShortAnswer, Cloze, MultipleChoice)
     - [ ] Edit existing card
     - [ ] Delete card with confirmation
     - [ ] Start Mastery session and complete 5 reviews
     - [ ] Start Cram session and complete 5 reviews
     - [ ] Open Analytics view and verify charts render
     - [ ] Open command palette (Ctrl+P)
     - [ ] Search for cards with debouncing
     - [ ] Apply filters and verify results
     - [ ] Toast notifications appear and dismiss
     - [ ] Error modal displays on simulated error
     - [ ] Window resizes and geometry persists
     - [ ] FPS counter shows 60 FPS
     - [ ] Take screenshots for documentation

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

5. **Windows Build Verification** (1 day)
   - Test vcpkg dependency installation
   - Build with MinGW
   - Test executable
   - Document Windows-specific issues

6. **Performance Testing** (1-2 days)
   - Create test database with 10k+ cards
   - Measure FPS
   - Profile memory usage
   - Optimize bottlenecks

7. **Additional Card Types** (3-5 days)
   - **Priority 1 (Important)**: Typing with regex validation, Ordering, Matching
   - **Priority 2 (Nice to Have)**: CodeOutput, DebugFix, Compare
   - **Priority 3 (Future)**: Explain, PracticalTask, LabelDiagram, AudioPrompt
   - Test each type with validation

8. **Integration Tests** (2-3 days)
   - Create automated test suite
   - Test card CRUD operations
   - Test session workflows
   - Test import/export
   - Test analytics

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

9. **Advanced Features**
   - Cloud sync
   - Collaborative decks
   - Mobile companion app
   - Plugin system
   - Advanced analytics (forgetting curves)

10. **Polish**

## Estimated Timeline to MVP

Assuming focused development:

| Component | Estimate | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Import/Export DB Integration | 2 days | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Font Assets | 1 hour | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Icon Assets | 4 hours | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Runtime Verification | 1 day | ‚ùå Not Started |
| Windows Build Test | 1 day | ‚ùå Not Started |
| Bug Fixes | 1 day | ‚ùå Not Started |
| **Total** | **~3 days remaining** | |

## Known Technical Debt

1. **Schema Mismatch**
   - Current schema uses prompt/response vs spec's question/answer
   - SRS state embedded in cards vs separate table
   - Decision: Keep current schema (works well, refactoring not critical)

2. **Card Type Coverage**
   - Only 7 of 14 spec types
   - Decision: Implement additional types as needed, not blocking for MVP

3. **Missing Spec Features**
   - No settings table (using config files instead)
   - No attachments table (media handled differently)
   - Decision: Current approach works, spec differences acceptable

4. **Test Coverage**
   - No automated test suite yet
   - Manual testing only
   - Decision: Add tests incrementally
